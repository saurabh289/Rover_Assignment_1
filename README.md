# Rover_Assignment_1
A ROS package with a node that subscribes to an image topic, detects a green box visible in the image and publishes the coordinates of the centre of the box.

Request:- I am using GitHub on browser, so, I was unable to upload image, as it was larger than 25 MB.
I was completing my TA 101A CAD assignments until 5 pm on 19th MAY 2020. So I didn't get ample time to complete this Assignment 1 of Rover project. Therfore, I was completely dependent on the tutorial,you had given.Much of the code is same as your's, but I tried to understand it. I am really sorry for this.
